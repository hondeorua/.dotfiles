1. Install Apple's Command Line Tools, which are prerequisites for Git and Homebrew.

```zsh
xcode-select --install
```


2. Clone repo into new hidden directory.

```zsh
# Use SSH (if set up)...
git clone git@github.com:hondeorua/.dotfiles.git
```

3. Install Homebrew, followed by the software listed in the Brewfile.

```zsh
# These could also be in an install script.

# Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Then pass in the Brewfile location...
brew bundle --file ~/.dotfiles/Brewfile

# ...or move to the directory first.
cd ~/.dotfiles && brew bundle
```

4. Create symlinks in the Home directory to the real files in the repo.

```zsh
stow .
```
